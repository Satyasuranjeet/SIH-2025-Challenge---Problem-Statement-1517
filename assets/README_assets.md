# Assets Directory

This directory contains visual assets for the project documentation.

## Screenshots

To complete the documentation, add the following screenshot:
- `web_interface_demo.png` - Screenshot of the Streamlit web interface showing successful query processing

This screenshot should show:
- Query input: "I want to visit Paris, London, and maybe Tokyo"
- Results showing matched entities with confidence scores
- The clean, professional interface layout

## Instructions
1. Save your screenshot as `web_interface_demo.png` in this assets directory
2. The README.md already references this image location
3. For GitHub/GitLab hosting, ensure the image is committed to the repository

## Alternative Options
If you prefer a different location for images:
1. Update the image path in README.md line that references `./assets/web_interface_demo.png`
2. Move the screenshot to your preferred location
3. Update the path accordingly
